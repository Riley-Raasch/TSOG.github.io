## What is Amateur Radio?

Amateur Radio is a hobby surrounding learning about radio technology, communicating with others locally and around the world, and playing with electronics. There's tons of ways to participate - including building your own equipment, setting up in a park or on a mountain, and experimenting with sending data over radio using computer software.

## Do I need a license?

Amateur Radio does require a license to access the wide array of frequencies the hobby is granted. The beginning license in the US, Technician, is easy to obtain, allows you to operate on 144 and 440 MHz frequencies as well as send digital data and morse code around the world on 28 MHz. 

The only cost to obtain a license is $35, paid to the FCC for any fees regarding the applications. Any upgrades in license class are free!
